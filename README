This is the code for a simple arduino accessory that shows your CPU and memory
usage with a bunch of PWMed LEDs.

The computer-side daemon gets its info from proc, so this is currently linux
specific.

Currently only CPU and Memory usage are displayed (and you need to modify 
source to change which LEDs, or if you have more than 2 cores), but I do
intend to eventually add hard disk / network activity as well.
